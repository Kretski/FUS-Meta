# Azuro Creator – Full Architecture (Conceptual)

![Azuro Creator Full Architecture](architecture.png)

**Azuro Creator** is a conceptual AI framework designed to automate and optimize engineering design processes. It integrates

- **Input Processing:** NLP + Semantic Parser extracts parameters, constraints, and goals; Units-aware Type System ensures dimensional accuracy.
- **Design Synthesis:** Intent Mapper and Design Synthesizer generate CAD, KiCad, SOPs, and code.
- **Optimization:** Orchestrator with GravOptAdaptiveE, BO/GA, and multi-fidelity scheduling (surrogate → solver).
- **Validation & Deployment:** Surrogate Models/PINNs for rapid validation, High-fidelity Solvers (OpenFOAM, COMSOL), and deployment to edge (microTVM) or HPC (containers).

**Vision:** Bridges human intuition with AI automation, featuring human-in-the-loop approval and HWID-locked licensing. Code is in development—feedback welcome!
